Yaml file
Yet another markup language / yamal ain't another markup language
what is markup language : it provides child parent relationship. It describes the structure
It is a data format like json and xml files.

DATA SERIALIZATION is the process of converting the data into the stream of bytes or you must say more complex data structres.

data deserialization is the process of reverse than the conversion of stream to object.

where object could be code + data or just the data or just the code.
If yaml and html both are markup language then why yaml is called it ain't another markup language?
->it's because of the html can only store the documents and relationship between parent and child whereas yaml can store that too as well as the data and objects.
It's used in configuration files, like docker and kuberneties
It can also be used in logs and caches etc.
